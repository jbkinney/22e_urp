If you are using `python 3.8+` and prefer running the notebook in an iPython kernel locally, please use this notebook: 

https://colab.research.google.com/github/jbkinney/22e_urp/blob/main/lecture_7/Lecture_7_bioimage_analysis.ipynb

### B)
To access the Bio-image Analysis Notebook via Google Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/jbkinney/22e_urp/blob/main/lecture_7/Lecture_7_bioimage_analysis_colab_version.ipynb


There will issues with running Part 1 in Colab environment due to incompatibility in the graph interfaces, but screenshots of the GUI are displayed (Part 1 is view-only for the Colab version).

Please add the two demo micrograph `mitosis_mod.tif` and `plant_cell.tiff` to your Google Drive before running it in Colab.
